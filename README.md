# Nidavellir

**Nidavellir** is a statically-typed programming language designed to provide low-overhead syntax while maintaining native execution and explicit compiler control.

The compiler driver for Nidavellir is **`nidac`**.

---

## Identity & Core Philosophy

- **Language vs. Driver**: **Nidavellir** is the programming language (source files use the `.nida` extension). **`nidac`** is the compiler driver.
- **Bootstrap Implementation**: The compiler frontend is currently implemented in Python as a bootstrapping stage. The long-term architectural goal is a self-hosting compiler.
- **Native Execution**: `nidac` compiles source code into native executables by generating C target code and invoking the native compiler toolchain (GCC/Clang). It does not use a virtual machine (VM), bytecode interpreter, or JIT engine as its primary execution model.
- **Static Typing without Annotation Overhead**: Variables in Nidavellir are statically typed, but explicit type annotations (such as `u8 a = 2`) are normally unnecessary. Static representations are determined at compile time using static analysis, dataflow propagation, and range reasoning.
- **Fixed Compile-Time Types**: Type inference operates statically before code generation. Inferred types do not change at runtime.
- **Opt-in Dynamic Semantics**: The language is designed to support an explicit `@dynamic` directive for cases where dynamic behavior is requested.
- **Top-Level Code**: Source files do not require a mandatory C-style `main()` function. Top-level statements are placed directly into the program entry point by the compilation pipeline.

## AutoTypeDef & Range Analysis

The `AutoTypeDef` system performs static range, interval, and constraint reasoning across expressions, loops, and control flow paths.

The static analysis engine evaluates:
- Integer constants and arithmetic expressions
- Binary operations and comparison predicates
- Symbol usage and dataflow constraints
- Function parameters and return values
- Loop bounds and loop-carried variable updates
- Control-flow branch paths
- Division and modulo safety, including compile-time division-by-zero detection

### Example: Compile-Time Range Analysis

```python
a = 2
c = 0
while c < 10:
    print(a)
    c += 1
    a *= c
```

The initial value `a = 2` does not restrict `a` to a minimal type if subsequent loop operations increase its value range. The `AutoTypeDef` engine evaluates potential value bounds across loop iterations at compile time and assigns a suitable fixed integer representation (e.g., `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`).

*Note: Current range analysis evaluates bounds during compilation passes. A generalized fixed-point abstract interpretation dataflow solver is planned as future work.*

## Memory Model

Nidavellir does not use a garbage collector (GC) or a managed runtime. The language is designed around explicit memory management and compiler-controlled allocation.

The following memory-management features are part of the language design and are planned for implementation:

- **Allocation Strategy Directives**: `@use_stack`, `@alwaysStack`, `@alwaysHeap`, and `@useMalloc` for explicitly selecting memory allocation strategies.
- **Low-Level Safety**: Ownership and lifetime verification are planned as part of the language's low-level memory architecture.

## Compiler Pipeline & Intermediate Representations

The conceptual compilation pipeline is:

```

        │
        ▼
   [Lexer Engine]
        │  (Tokens)
        ▼
   [Parser Engine]
        │  (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST)
        ▼
[Import-Tree Analysis]
        │  (Direct C Header/Library Parsing)
        ▼
[Semantic / Symbol Analyzer]
        │  (Symbol Table & Scope Resolution)
        ▼
[AutoTypeDef Engine]
        │  (Static Range & Interval Reasoning)
        ▼

        ▼
  [HIR Passes / Lowering]
        │
        ▼
  [LIR Lowerer]
        │  (Low-Level IR & Basic-Block CFG)
        ▼

        ▼

        │
        ▼

```

### Intermediate Representations (HIR and LIR)

HIR and LIR are Nidavellir's actual internal intermediate representations. C is not an intermediate representation; it is the backend target output emitted for consumption by GCC or Clang.

- **HIR (High-Level Intermediate Representation)**: Preserves semantic language-level structures for high-level compiler passes and analysis.
- **LIR (Low-Level Intermediate Representation)**: A lower-level representation structured around basic blocks and explicit value instructions.
  - LIR primitives include `ConstLIR`, `LoadLIR`, `StoreLIR`, `DeclareLIR`, `CallLIR`, `ReturnLIR`, `AddLIR`, `SubLIR`, `MulLIR`, `DivLIR`, `ModLIR`, `GtLIR`, `LtLIR`, `ArgLIR`, `BlockLIR`, `JumpLIR`, `BranchLIR`, `ReturnLIR`, and `FunctionLIR`.
  - **Declaration vs. Assignment**: Variable definition (`DeclareLIR`) and assignment to an existing variable (`StoreLIR`) are semantically distinct LIR operations.

### Control Flow Graph (CFG) & Basic Blocks

Control-flow structures (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`) are lowered into basic blocks (`BlockLIR`) terminated strictly by control-flow instructions (`JumpLIR`, `BranchLIR`, `ReturnLIR`).

- No normal instructions are emitted after a block terminator.
- Block IDs and Value IDs exist in separate namespaces.
- Conceptual basic-block lowering for a `while` loop:
  ```
  Bcond:
      evaluate condition
      BranchLIR condition, Bbody, Bmerge

  Bbody:
      loop body statements
      JumpLIR Bcond

  Bmerge:
      continuation statements
  ```

## C Backend & Direct C Header/Library Import

### C Backend Target

The C backend is an intentional target emission format used to produce native binaries via GCC or Clang while maintaining ABI compatibility with existing C libraries. 

Nidavellir semantics are fully analyzed and lowered into HIR and LIR before C emission occurs. Therefore, C code emission is an intermediate code generation step rather than a syntax-to-syntax transpilation pass.

### Direct C ABI Integration

Nidavellir supports importing C headers and native libraries directly through its import syntax:

```python
from math import cos

res = cos(3.14159)
```

- Imported C symbols are parsed directly into the compiler's symbol table and participate in type analysis.
- Symbols are namespaced where necessary to avoid collisions.
- C header integration operates at compile time and does not use IPC, dynamic runtime bridges, or Python `ctypes`/`cffi` marshaling.

---

## Native Runtime Support

Nidavellir includes a C runtime support layer (`Nida_core.h`, `print.h`).

This runtime provides helper infrastructure for generated C code (such as print functions and core runtime primitives). It is not a virtual machine and does not execute or interpret bytecode.

---

## Planned Compiler Directives

The following directives are part of the language design but are not implemented yet:

- `@nidac(pedantic)` — strict compiler diagnostics.
- `@use_stack`, `@alwaysStack`, `@alwaysHeap`, `@useMalloc` — explicit memory strategy selection.
